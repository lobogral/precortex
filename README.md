# PreCortex

This is a program developed to add multiple layers to the prefrontal cortex, thereby preventing certain stimuli from affecting behavior, perception, or memory.

It can be considered a way for the user to increase browser control over any type of website.

## What does it include?

**Whitelist:** Allows the websites the user chooses, and their corresponding subdomains; everything else will be blocked.

**Gray Style:** Prevents color-based distractions from selected websites.

**Limit Scrolling:** Warns when scrolling exceeds the number of items.

**No Recommendation:** Prevents distractions from recommendations.

**Limit Immersion:** Prevents distractions from spending too much time on selected websites.

**No Content:** Prevents unwanted content from visiting a website.

**No Clipboard:** Prevents accidents when using the keyboard shortcuts: Cut, Copy, Paste, and Enter.

**Limit Click:** Gives a confirmation message when clicking.

## Do you have practical examples?

These are the default rules, within the **See Cortices** menu, when you click the extension icon.

## How to further your knowledge of the tool?

The ideal is:

1. Learn the concept of XPATH.
2. Learn the concept of domain and URL (they are different).
3. Press F12, then Ctrl+F in Browser, to search for elements with Inspect.

## Which browsers does it work for?
